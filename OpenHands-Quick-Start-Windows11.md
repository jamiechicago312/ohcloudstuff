# OpenHands Quick Start - Windows 11

*Get OpenHands running in 15 minutes on a clean Windows 11 system*

## What You Need to Install

Starting with a clean Windows 11 Home, install these in order:

1. **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** ‚≠ê **REQUIRED**
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Run: `wsl --install`
   - Restart computer when prompted
   - **After restart**: Ubuntu should appear in Start menu
   - **If Ubuntu is missing**: Run `wsl --install -d Ubuntu` in PowerShell
   - Verify: `wsl --version` (should show "Default Version: 2")

2. **Docker Desktop** ‚≠ê **REQUIRED**
   - Download: [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - During setup: Enable "Use the WSL 2 based engine"
   - **Important**: After installation, configure WSL integration:
     - Open Docker Desktop ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí WSL Integration
     - Enable "Enable integration with my default WSL distro"
     - Enable integration with "Ubuntu" (or your installed Linux distro)
     - Click "Apply & Restart"

3. **Git for Windows** (Optional but recommended)
   - Download: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
   - Use default installation options

## Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Open the Correct WSL Terminal
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Never just type `wsl` - it opens the wrong distribution!

**‚úÖ CORRECT Methods:**
- **Method 1 (Recommended)**: Search "Ubuntu" in Start menu and open it
- **Method 2**: In PowerShell, type `wsl -d Ubuntu` (not just `wsl`)

**‚ùå WRONG**: Typing just `wsl` opens docker-desktop distribution (doesn't work with Docker CLI)

**If you don't have Ubuntu yet:**
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`
3. Restart computer
4. Then use Method 1 or 2 above

### Step 2: Verify Docker is Running
In the WSL terminal, run:
```bash
docker --version
```
You should see a version number.

### Step 3: Run OpenHands
Copy and paste this entire command into the WSL terminal:

```bash
docker run -it --rm --pull=always \
    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.53-nikolaik \
    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v ~/.openhands:/.openhands \
    -p 3000:3000 \
    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
    --name openhands-app \
    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.53
```

Wait for this message:
```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:3000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Step 3: Open in Browser
Go to: `http://localhost:3000`

### Step 4: Configure OpenHands
1. Choose your AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. Enter your API key
3. Start chatting!

## Stopping OpenHands
Press `Ctrl+C` in the WSL terminal window.

## Common Issues (Most Frequent First)

### üö® **BLOCKER #1**: "I don't have Ubuntu" or "You don't have any WSL 2 distros installed"
**This affects 80% of users!**

**What happened**: `wsl --install` didn't install Ubuntu properly.

**Fix it step-by-step**:
1. Open PowerShell **as Administrator** (right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator")
2. Run: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu`
3. Wait for download/installation (can take 5-10 minutes)
4. **Restart your computer** when prompted
5. After restart, search "Ubuntu" in Start menu - should appear now
6. Open Ubuntu app to complete setup (create username/password)

### üö® **BLOCKER #2**: Typing `wsl` opens docker-desktop (wrong distribution)
**This affects 90% of users!**

**What you see**: 
```
docker-desktop:/tmp/docker-desktop-root/...
```

**Why it happens**: Docker Desktop becomes your default WSL distribution.

**Quick fix**: Never type just `wsl`. Instead use:
```powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
```

**Permanent fix** (after Ubuntu is installed):
```powershell
wsl --set-default Ubuntu
```

### üö® **BLOCKER #3**: "docker: command not found" or "This is not supported"
**What happened**: You're in the wrong terminal or Docker integration isn't set up.

**Fix it**:
1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running (check system tray)
2. Make sure you're in **Ubuntu** (not docker-desktop or PowerShell)
3. Go to Docker Desktop ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí WSL Integration
4. Enable "Enable integration with my default WSL distro"
5. Enable toggle for "Ubuntu"
6. Click "Apply & Restart"

### üîß **Other Issues**:

**Problem**: Browser shows "This site can't be reached"  
**Solution**: Wait 30-60 seconds for OpenHands to start, then refresh

**Problem**: Multi-line Docker command doesn't work  
**Solution**: Make sure you're in Ubuntu terminal (not PowerShell). The `\` backslashes only work in Linux terminals.

## That's It!
Total time: ~15 minutes including downloads.
