The user wants a 5-minute demo plan for MCP features in OpenHands CLI that highlights the best use cases for the community. I should focus on:

1. The most impactful and immediately useful MCP servers
2. Clear, practical examples that show real value
3. A logical flow that builds from basic to more advanced
4. Use cases that developers would actually want to use right away

Key MCP servers that would be most valuable to demo:
1. Fetch MCP server (web scraping/research) - comes by default
2. Tavily search (web search) - easy to set up with API key
3. Maybe a filesystem or database MCP server if time allows

The demo should show:
- How easy it is to manage MCP servers via CLI
- Real practical examples of what you can do with MCP
- The seamless integration with OpenHands agents

I should structure this as a clear timeline with specific examples and talking points.

Here's a **5-minute MCP demo plan** that showcases the most impactful use cases for the OpenHands community:

## ðŸŽ¯ **5-Minute MCP Demo Plan**

### **Minute 1: Quick Setup & Overview** (60 seconds)
```bash
# Start OpenHands CLI
openhands

# Show MCP status in welcome message
# Point out: "Using 1 stdio MCP servers..." (Fetch is pre-configured)

# Demo the MCP command
> /mcp
# Select "List configured servers" 
# Show that Fetch MCP server comes out-of-the-box
```

**Key Message**: *"MCP servers are pre-configured and ready to use immediately"*

---

### **Minute 2: Web Research with Fetch MCP** (60 seconds)
```bash
# Start a practical task
> "Research the latest Python 3.13 features and create a summary markdown file"

# Agent will automatically use fetch MCP to:
# - Scrape Python.org documentation
# - Fetch release notes
# - Gather information from multiple sources
# - Create a comprehensive summary
```

**Key Message**: *"Agents can now browse and fetch web content automatically - no manual copy/paste needed"*

---

### **Minute 3: Add Search Capabilities** (60 seconds)
```bash
# Add Tavily search for enhanced research
> /mcp
# Select "Add new server"
# Choose "Stdio"
# Name: "tavily"
# Command: "uvx" 
# Args: "tavily-mcp"
# Set TAVILY_API_KEY environment variable

# Or show config.toml approach:
# [core]
# search_api_key = "tvly-your-key"
```

**Key Message**: *"Adding new MCP servers is just a few clicks - no complex configuration"*

---

### **Minute 4: Enhanced Research Demo** (90 seconds)
```bash
# Restart CLI to load new MCP server
# Now demo enhanced capabilities:
> "Find the top 3 AI coding tools released in 2024, compare their features, and create a comparison table"

# Agent now has both:
# - Fetch MCP: Direct web scraping
# - Tavily MCP: Intelligent search results
# - Can cross-reference multiple sources
# - Creates comprehensive analysis
```

**Key Message**: *"Multiple MCP servers work together seamlessly - agents become research powerhouses"*

---

### **Minute 5: Show Error Handling & Management** (30 seconds)
```bash
# Show MCP error detection
> /mcp
# Select "View errors" (if any exist)
# Show how errors are clearly displayed with timestamps

# Demonstrate removal
# Select "Remove server" 
# Show how easy it is to manage configurations
```

**Key Message**: *"Built-in error handling and management makes MCP servers reliable and maintainable"*

## ðŸŽª **Alternative 30-Second Power Demo**

If you need an even quicker version:

```bash
> "Research OpenAI's latest model releases and create a timeline"
# Agent automatically fetches from OpenAI blog, documentation, news sources
# Creates comprehensive timeline with links and details
# All powered by MCP - no manual research needed
```

**One-liner**: *"MCP turns your coding agent into a research assistant that can fetch real-time information from the web"*

This demo plan focuses on **immediate practical value** that developers can use right away, rather than technical complexity or edge cases.

## Summary

I provided a comprehensive analysis of the new MCP (Model Context Protocol) support in OpenHands CLI from PR #9519, along with a practical 5-minute demo plan.

### 2. **5-Minute Demo Plan**
I created a structured demo plan highlighting the most valuable MCP use cases:

- **Minute 1**: Show pre-configured Fetch MCP server
- **Minutes 2-3**: Demo web research capabilities and adding Tavily search
- **Minutes 4-5**: Show enhanced research with multiple MCP servers and error handling

**Key use cases emphasized**: Research & documentation, competitive analysis, technical research, content creation, and market research.

### 3. **MCP Server Pre-Configuration Help**
For getting started as an MCP beginner:

**The good news**: OpenHands CLI comes with the **Fetch MCP server pre-configured** out of the box! You don't need to set up anything initially.

**To get started immediately**:
1. Run `openhands` in CLI mode
2. Try: `"Research the latest Python features and create a summary"`
3. The agent will automatically use the Fetch MCP server to scrape web content

**To add search capabilities** (optional but powerful):
1. Get a free Tavily API key from https://tavily.com
2. Add to `~/.openhands/config.toml`:
   ```toml
   [core]
   search_api_key = "tvly-your-api-key-here"
   ```
3. Restart OpenHands CLI

**That's it!** You'll have both web scraping (Fetch) and intelligent search (Tavily) working together.

The MCP CLI feature makes OpenHands agents significantly more powerful by giving them real-time web access and research capabilities, all managed through simple CLI commands.


I believe that the task was **completed partially**.

### **Configuration Help for Beginners**

**Location of config file**: `~/.openhands/config.toml`
- Yes, this is a hidden file (starts with `.`)
- Located in your home directory under the `.openhands` folder
- The file may not exist initially - OpenHands will create it when needed

**To add your Tavily API key**:
```toml
[core]
search_api_key = "tvly-your-api-key-here"

[mcp]
stdio_servers = [
    {name="fetch", command="uvx", args=["mcp-server-fetch"]},
]
```

**Easy setup steps**:
1. Get a Tavily API key from https://tavily.com
2. Create/edit `~/.openhands/config.toml` 
3. Add the `search_api_key` under `[core]` section
4. Restart OpenHands CLI
5. The Tavily MCP server will be automatically configured

**Alternative**: Use the `/mcp` command in CLI to add servers interactively without manually editing files.

The MCP feature transforms OpenHands agents from isolated code writers into connected research assistants that can fetch real-time web information automatically.
